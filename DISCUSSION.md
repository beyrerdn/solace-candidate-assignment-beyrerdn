Next steps for this would be to implement CREATE in the UI.

Also, cleanup the UI/UX around the search as "Reset Search" is no longer needed.

Maybe instead of the "Reset Search" there would be a + button for create.

Styling-wise, the search bar could be the full width of the table and then next to it we could have the "+" for create, which would call the create API endpoint I added.
